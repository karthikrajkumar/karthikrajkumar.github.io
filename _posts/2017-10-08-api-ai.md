## How to build a chat bot instantly
You dont have to be an expert or to even know Artificial intelligence ([natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)) to build a chatbot these days. Building and integrating to the application has become quite easy with tools like api.ai now called dialogflow.com. Dialogflow uses natural language understanding basically advanced text processing and learns on the fly.

If you would like to build an interactive FAQ, then using a chatbot would be a best choice. 


#### Getting started with Dialogflow.com
##### Lets build a sample fitness bot and we shall integrate it with the application of our choice and connect it with google assistant

- Logon to your google account.
- Open actions.google.com and click Actions Console on the top right screen.
- You will be taken to Actions on Google console screen.

Note: There will be a seperate project created in the google cloud platform related to the fitness app automatically.

Once the angent is saved, you will now be able to create intents and entities. For reference there will be default welcome and the fallback entity.
